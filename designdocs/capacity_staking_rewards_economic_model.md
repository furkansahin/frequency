# Capacity Staking Rewards Economic Model


## Context and Scope:
The Frequency Transaction Payment system uses Capacity to pay for certain transactions on chain.  Accounts that wish to pay with Capacity must:
1. Have an [MSA](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/frequency/blob/main/designdocs/accounts.md)
2. Be a [Provider](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/frequency/blob/main/designdocs/provider_registration.md) (see also [Provider Permissions and Grants](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/frequency/blob/main/designdocs/provider_permissions.md))
3. Stake a minimum amount of FRQCY token to receive [Capacity](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/frequency/blob/main/designdocs/capacity.md).

There is also a business case for allowing any token holder to lock up its tokens in exchange for a reward - known as _staking_ - while also targeting a Provider to receive some Capacity.

That means it won't be a separate package, and the code will be tailored for this repo. One might also say that the scope is also limited to developer testing, so it's not meant to be used in CI or a test environment such as a test blockchain network.)

## Problem Statement:
A system consisting only of providers and coinless users who delegate to providers will tend toward centralization.
To build a self-sustaining Frequency network where control is decentralized, a variety of economic solutions are needed.  One of these is the ability to stake FRQCY token in return for something; this creates an incentive for participation and involvement with the chain fundamentals and governance.

How is that so?  Capacity is how Frequency intends Providers to pay for the vast majority of their on-chain messages. If Providers receive some capacity when end users stake, then they lose capacity if those end users unstake. If a Provider's Capacity from Reward staking is significant, this gives Reward Stakers some power over Providers. If a Provider is utilizing all or nearly all their Capacity almost every Epoch -- which they should be if trying to be economical --  then even a small percentage of lost Capacity will literally cost them to replace it.

We imagine that FRQCY could be airdropped by various entities to encourage onboarding, including Providers themselves. Providers may offer airdrops in exchange for such things as bringing in new users, or sharing links on other platforms, then encourage their users to stake their FRQCY for rewards.  Rewards could be exchanged for in-dApp benefits such as premium features, special emoji, avatar customization, and the like.  Rewards Staking could also unlock features.

## Assumptions
* The exact formula for calculating rewards is determined in advance and used in the implementation of this design.
* Rewards are not prorated; they are calculated based on the staking account balance at the start of an Era.
* Like other blockchains, we round away "dust", values that are _10<sup>-tbd</sup>_ FRQCY or less.

## To be decided:
* Is Reward Pool token total itself fixed (with input values determined by governance), or is it the Reward _rate_ that is fixed?
* What are the inputs to the economic model(s) for Capacity generation and Rewards?
* How does the capacity generated by Maximized Capacity Staking differ from that generated by Rewards Capacity Staking? Maximized is more than Rewards, but by how much?
* Are rewards compounded?

## Economic Model
By "economic model" we mean the formulae used to manage staking rewards to achieve the goals of decentralization, economic stabiilty, and sustainability.

Inputs in the economic model to consider could include:
* Proportion of accounts are staking to total accounts
* Mean number MSAs per Provider, or the mean compared to median.
* Proportion of token staked to free balance held by non-Treasury accounts
* The Capacity-per-Epoch use rate, perhaps averaged over N epochs
* The length of an Epoch in blocks
* The length of an Era n blocks

These could be used to adjust the cost of capacity and the reward return percentage.

Example 1: We want a specific percentage of token accounts to stake in order to meet a certain decentralization goal, and we are below that amount.  We increase the reward rate to encourage token holders to stake, without adjusting the cost of capacity.

Example 2: Capacity is consistently under-utilized:  We could decrease the cost of Capacity without changing the reward rate to encourage all Providers to post more often.  We could also decrease the reward rate, which would cause some unstaking and reduce the available Capacity in the network.

Example 3: The median number of MSAs per provider is significantly lower than the mean, which could indicate a handful of Providers (or just one) are dominating Capacity use, which could mean a trend toward centralization.  We could decrease the cost of Capacity to encourage all Providers to post more often, and to encourage more new Providers.  We could also increase the reward rate to encourage more staking, which could also provide capacity to new Providers.

### Example possible calculations for rewards:
There are many possible calculations but here are some ideas about what factors could influence the rewards and how they could be incorporated, starting with very simple (and also very unlikely) to complicated (probably also not likely).

For a reward pool _RP_ or individual rewards _R_, Total Staked Token _t_, number of Stakers _s_, number of Providers _p_, total Capacity generated by Maximized staking c<sub>m</sub>, total Capacity generated by Rewards staking c<sub>r</sub>

| Description| Governance constants | Example Equation|
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| _R_ is fixed at some percent _M_ of _t_| M | $R = {Mt}$ |
| _RP_ is linear and rewards decentralization of Stakers and Providers | N,M,P | $RP = {Nt + Ms + Pp \over 100}$ |
| _RP_ is some polynomial of order _i,j_ | N,M,P | $RP = { Nt + Ms^i + Pp^j }$ |

Lastly, Rewards/Capacity could be based on a more complex equation, perhaps which depends on the size of the targeted Provider.

We could implement diminishing returns on rewards and/or capacity.  This would reward smaller Providers and stakers who target them much more than "whales". The coefficient could be adjusted based on total number of accounts, number of Providers, total token staked, etc, depending on where we want the "hump" to be for most Providers and stakers; we would probably want it significantly above their average Capacity level so that purchasing more Capacity is still approximately a linear return, whereas much larger participants ("whales") would have to spend more money to get the same increase in Capacity.

Such a system could diminish the "nothing succeeds like success" effect, however, if the effect is too strong, whales could be driven off the platform since growth is too expensive.  It would need to be carefully tailored so new Providers could grow their presence relatively easily.  This is much different from the norm of resource acquisition, where "bulk discounts" dominate.

Since there is no difference to the chain for what Provider is posting what message, a "bulk discount" for posting Capacity messages doesn't apply.

### One way to set the difference between Maximized and Reward Staking

## Goals
* Outline the architecture for the implementation of staking rewards for Capacity.
* Allow staking rewards parameters to be adjusted without a chain upgrade.
* Prevent rewards storage operations and calculations from excessively weighing down blocks.
* Disallow receiving staking rewards for token that is not staked for a full Era.
* Prevent staking and unstaking "spam" which would destabilize the chain token economy and slow down block formation due to excessive database read/writes.
* Create a living design document that changes as compelling new findings and needs arise

## Non-goals
* Do not finalize names, functions, storage types and shape of storage and structs
* Do not determine the actual amount of rewards - either in Capacity or FRQCY - for staking
* Do not account for other economic incentives on the Frequency network, such as collator rewards.
* Cannot account for token price in any other currency.
* Do not change how paying for transactions with Capacity works

## Proposal:
Any Frequency account with a set minimum amount of FRQCY to may stake token to the network.
On staking, the staker designates a type of staking, plus a target Provider to receive Capacity.
There are two types of staking, **Maximized Capacity Staking** and **Rewards Capacity Staking**.
In both types, the staker designates a target Provider who receives capacity upon staking.
The difference is:

* With **Maximized Capacity Staking**, the target Provider receives more Capacity than it would with Rewards Capacity Staking.
  The staker does not receive any token rewards.
* With **Rewards Capacity Staking**, the target Provider shares rewards with the staker.
  The target Provider receives some Capacity, and the staker receives periodic rewards in FRQCY.


Whenever `StakingAccountDetails.total` changes, either by staking more or unstaking, rewards are calculated, minted and transferred immediately.  Rewards may also be claimed directly for a specific AccountId by calling an extrinsic. In either case, `StakingAccountDetails.total` is updated to be the current era.  Rewards are paid out from `last_rewarded_at` to `current_era() - 1` by applying the RewardsPoolParameters to each Era.


Whenever a Rewards Pool calculation is changed, it goes into effect at the start of the next Era. The new Rewards parameters are pushed to storage, and, assuming the history queue is full, the oldest one is removed.

A special condition of this is a blend of the above:  some staking accounts could be large enough that if their staking balance changes significantly, it also affects the Reward Pool significantly for all staking accounts.  Such accounts are called "whales" in blockchain jargon.  We deem "significant" change as greater than or equal to one hundredth of a percent (0.01%), rounded.  If so, a new set of Rewards parameters is pushed.  We _may_ need to extend the thaw period for a staking account when their unstaking will cause a RewardsPool history push, in order to strongly reduce incentives for staking/unstaking spam.
